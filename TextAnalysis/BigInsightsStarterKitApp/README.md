This is one of the sample applications discussed in this [article](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/real-time-text)
This is the Streams application that loads and runs the extractor created in the [BigInsights Starter Kit](https://ibm-open-platform.ibm.com/biginsights/starterkits/biginsights-starter-kit2-cloud/starterkit2cloud.html#/starterkit)

To compile and run the application, you'll need:
- The com.ibm.streams.text toolkit in Streams 4.1
- [Version 1.1.1](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.json/releases) or greater of the com.ibm.streamsx.json toolkit.
Once the application is compiled and you have submitted the job, open the following URL in a browser  `http://<pe_host>:9899/textAnalytics` to view the running application.
