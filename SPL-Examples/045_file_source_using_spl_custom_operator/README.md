This example shows how to create source operators using the Custom operator available in the SPL standard toolkit. Starting in Streams 3.x, it is possible to create source operators without writing primitive source operators in C++ or Java. Simple source operators can be written using the built-in SPL Custom operator. This will come handy for those who don't want to do an extra layer of C++ or Java code for satisfying simple needs for a source operator. You will see a function of a file source operator being implemented all using SPL code in this example.
