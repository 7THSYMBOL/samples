This example demonstrates one of the important features desired in the real world (mostly in the Retail banking and in the Telco industries). In many real-world scenarios, they still work via files and such files get dropped into a directory for processing. It is shown here how the DirectoryScan operator picks up a new file as soon as it appears inside an input directory. (Apply caution if huge files are copied to the watch directory. DirectoryScan may detect that big file copy as multiple new files and output multiple tuples with the same file name.)
