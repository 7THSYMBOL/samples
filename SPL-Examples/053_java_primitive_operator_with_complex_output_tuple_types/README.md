This example shows important features that can be done via a Java primitive operator. It shows how to do tracing and logging inside a Java operator. It also shows how we can create an output tuple inside a Java primitive operator to have a list of tuple objects carrying complex typed attributes.

[This example has a companion Java project called Java_Complex_Tuple_Type_Submission.]
