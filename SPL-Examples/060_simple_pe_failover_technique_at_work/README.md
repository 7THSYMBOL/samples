This example shows a way to protect the logic in an analytic operator  when its PE (Processing Element) or its host machine crashes. It uses a well-known fail-over technique that is done through a primary/secondary pair configured for an operator that will need safety from PE or machine crash. This example outlines a scheme for protecting the analytic logic written inside an SPL Custom operator against failures. When such failures occur, a specific fail-over technique employed here will continue the business logic without any interruption. This is done by making a secondary PE to takeover the tasks of the failed primary PE. Thus, the secondary PE does the detection of the primary PE's failure and then changes its role from a secondary PE to a new primary PE. All of this is done without losing any data during the fail-over. At the same time, the failed primary PE will be automatically restarted to do its work as a new secondary PE. This particular fail-over technique ensures that there is always a primary/secondary pair working in concert to provide high availability for a business-critical operator that is coded and configured in this manner.
