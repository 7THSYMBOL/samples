Certain classes of applications can make use of this facility to control the kind of data a source operator generates. In addition, this example shows how to pass one or more string literals to the C++ primitive operator as invocation time parameters. As a bonus, this example also shows a simple way to do performance measurement inside the SPL code using the built-in SPL high precision timestamp functions."}
