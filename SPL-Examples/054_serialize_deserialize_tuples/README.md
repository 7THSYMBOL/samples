This example shows a simple mechanism to serialize and deserialize SPL tuples. When large tuples need to be cached inside an operator's state variable, it will consume a lot of memory. To cut down the memory consumption, one possible option is to convert the large tuples into compact blobs through tuple serialization. When the actual tuple representation is needed, blob values can be converted back to the actual tuples through tuple deserialization. This same method can also be used to transmit data as blobs across operators. This serialization/deserialization approach is likely to add extra CPU overhead. If that extra overhead can be tolerated, then this approach would serve to be useful.
