This example shows a particular style of writing Streams applications that can be scaled up or scaled down as the application input workload changes. It uses a familiar scenario from the Financial Services Sector, where the price calculation engines will require scaling up when the market data load increases. Code written in this example uses a pattern for starting more instances of an analytic operator to increase parallelism. New instances of such analytic operators can be started on demand without disrupting the already running application flow. As soon as the newly started operator instances are ready, application load will be promptly distributed across the existing and the newly started instances of that operator. In the same way, when the application data load is not high, some of the most recently started operator instances can be stopped to release the CPU cores for other use. This technique is one of many ways to design Streams applications that will scale up and down dynamically according to the changing input data workload.
