This example shows how a Java primitive operator is created from scratch. Java primitive operator is different from JavaOp that you have seen earlier in a different example. Java primitive operator is a first class operator in SPL, whereas JavaOp only permits a callout to another Java operator. In addition, Java primitive operator has the advantage of keeping its name as the operatorâ€™s runtime instance name.

[This example has a companion Java PROJECT NAMED RSS_Reader_Primitive.]
