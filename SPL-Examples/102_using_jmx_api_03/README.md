This is a plain Java application written to show how one can use the JMX APIs available in Streams 4.x and higher versions. Using the JMX (Java Management Extensions) APIs, it is convenient to monitor and manage Streams artifacts. This example shows how one can use the Streams JMX API notifications to get alerted via callback functions about an inactivity timeout in a given Streams domain.
