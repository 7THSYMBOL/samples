This example shows how a Delay standard toolkit operator can be used to delay a stream. This example also introduces the Custom operator that can be used to perform custom logic. You can also notice the use of a state variable that is mutable inside the Custom operator. It also shows how to create a new tuple on the fly and do your own submissions onto the output ports.
