This particular example shows how a non-replay capable Source operator will not be a show stopper when it comes to employing the consistent region feature in such applications. When using sources (such as TCPSource) that can't realistically replay data, there is way to configure your application with consistent region by using an utility operator called ReplaybleStart (shipped with the Streams product). In this example, we will use a topology that uses TCPSource along with ReplayableStart to achieve application-level fault tolerance.  This example simulates the operator failure by  aborting one of the operators automatically when the application is in the middle of executing the logic. By doing that, the core fault tolerance feature of the consistent region will get triggered to recover from a failure that occurred in an application graph. It will prove that the tuples will not be missed and the Aggregate operator's window state will not be compromised during the course of the unexpected operator failure and the subsequent recovery/restoration.
