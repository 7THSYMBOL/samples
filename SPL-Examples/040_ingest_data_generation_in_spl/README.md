This example shows how SPL provides rich features to generate synthetic data required for large scale testing. Many real-life applications in the Telco and the Retail Banking sectors consume large amounts of daily business data through CSV formatted text files. There could be huge amounts of CDR data from several telecom circles or daily transaction data for millions of accounts in a retail bank.

While building and testing the SPL applications, it will become necessary to generate such ingest data files with artificial data that is close enough to be realistic. This application shows how such large amounts of data in several thousands of files can be created very quickly using the SPL standard toolkit operators as well as the SPL file IO and math random built-in functions.
