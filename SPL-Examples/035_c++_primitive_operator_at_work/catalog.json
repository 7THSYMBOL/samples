In this application, a C++ primitive operator model XML file can be explored to learn how the different fields in that file are configured. Then, the code generation template header and implementation files (*_h.cgt and *_cpp.cgt) can be browsed to learn about the primitive operator logic. Additionally, this example demonstrates about including a Java operator and a C++ primitive operator as part of the application flow."}
