They are Filter and Functor. Filter allows you to route tuples based on conditional checks. It provides two output ports to send the matched tuples on the first output port and the unmatched tuples on the second output port. Functor operator allows us to transform the incoming tuple attributes and then to send it on many different output ports with different stream schemas."}
