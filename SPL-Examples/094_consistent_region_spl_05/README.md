This particular example shows how only a portion of the topology will take part in the consistent region by having an autonomous section in the application graph. This example simulates the operator failure by aborting one of the operators automatically when the application is in the middle of executing the logic. By doing that, the core fault tolerance feature of the consistent region will get triggered to recover from a failure that occurred in an application graph. It will prove that the tuples will not be missed and the Join operator's window state will not be compromised during the course of the unexpected operator failure and the subsequent recovery/restoration. At the same time, parts of the application that is in the autonomous area will get duplicate tuples during a crash recovery happening in the consistent region of this application graph. This example's purpose is to make the users aware of this fact. In the autonomous area, measures need to be taken to do deduplication.
