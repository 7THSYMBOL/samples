This example shows off yet another powerful standard toolkit operator named the Aggregate. It is very good in computing on the fly aggregate values after collecting a set of tuples. Tuples are grouped based on tumbling and sliding windows with partitioned variants. This example also shows how to use the built-in assignment functions provided by this operator to compute regular statistical calculations such as min, max, average, standard deviation etc.
