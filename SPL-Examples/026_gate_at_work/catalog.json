This operator delays the incoming tuples until a downstream operator signals with an acknowledgment to receive any further tuples. This is a great way to have a feedback through which we can control the rate at which tuples are passed through. (Please refer to another example named 905_gate_load_balancer that shows the effectiveness of the Gate operator in combination with the ThreadedSplit operator to provide load balancing the incoming tuples.)"}
