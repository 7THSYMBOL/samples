This example shows a powerful feature of Streams to wrap existing code assets written using the Python programming language. This example teaches developers how to use the Streams C++ native functions to call any arbitrary Python function and return the results back to SPL code. In order to run this example, please follow the instructions specified in the README.txt file in the SPL project directory. You can also read a very detailed IBM developerWorks technical article about this example:
