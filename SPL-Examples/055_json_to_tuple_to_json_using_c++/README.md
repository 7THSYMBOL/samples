This example shows how an SPL application can consume JSON formatted data and convert it to SPL tuples. It also shows how to do the reverse action i.e. converting SPL tuples to JSON formatted data. JSON<-->Tuple bidirectional conversion is accomplished using an open source C++ JSON API. In order to run this application, you will be required to download an open source component that carries a BSD license. Please read the detailed instructions available in the SPL file for this project. There is also another SPL project that does similar conversion using Java (049_json_to_tuple_to_json_using_java).
