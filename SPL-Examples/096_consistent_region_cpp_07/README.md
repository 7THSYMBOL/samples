This particular example shows how a C++ primitive operator can play a role inside a consistent region. Please look at the CPP interface (.h) and the implementation (.cpp) files inside the SimpleSourceOp sub-directory in this SPL project. There are certain callback functions that the C++ operator developer needs to implement the checkpoint and restore state events. This example simulates the operator failure by  aborting one of the operators in the flow graph automatically when the application is in the middle of executing the logic. By doing that, the core fault tolerance feature of the consistent region will get triggered to recover from a failure that occurred in an application graph. It will prove that the tuples will not be missed during the course of the unexpected operator failure and the subsequent recovery/restoration.
